####Our dataset contains data on various restaurants that sell margharita pizza either online or offline.

We have collected data for 45 observations and recorded the values of their features as variables.
These variables are:
restaurant name, location, region, price and size of the margherita pizza, online rating of the restaurant, distance to CEU and whether the place is selling pizza only. 
For further information, see the variable-related document.
